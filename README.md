# RunnerBar

A macOS menu bar app that shows the status of your GitHub self-hosted runners at a glance.

> No Xcode. No Apple Developer account. No Gatekeeper dialogs. One `curl` command to install.

## The problem

You have self-hosted runners installed on your Mac. You have no idea if they're online, offline, or busy without navigating to GitHub.com. RunnerBar fixes that — a colored dot in your menu bar tells you instantly.

- 🟢 All runners online
- 🟡 Some runners offline  
- ⚫ All offline or none configured

Click the dot to see a full list of runners with their name, status, and repo/org scope.

---

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://eonist.github.io/runner-bar/install.sh | bash
```

That's it. No Gatekeeper dialog, no System Settings, no Apple ID.

---

## Requirements

- macOS 13+
- [`gh` CLI](https://cli.github.com) installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`)

RunnerBar uses your existing `gh` CLI session for auth — no PAT, no OAuth setup.

---

## How it works

1. On first launch, enter one or more repo slugs (`owner/repo`) or org names to monitor
2. RunnerBar polls the GitHub API every 30 seconds via `gh api`
3. The menu bar icon updates based on aggregate runner state
4. Click the icon to see the full runner list and refresh manually

## v0.1 scope

RunnerBar v0.1 is intentionally minimal — read-only visibility only.

Out of scope for v0.1:
- Registering or adding new runners
- Starting / stopping runner processes
- Notifications
- Multi-account support

See [issue #1](https://github.com/eonist/runner-bar/issues/1) for the full spec.
