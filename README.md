## The problem

1. Status - Knowing if your selfhosted github runner is online, offline, busy.
2. Mananging - Removing them. Adding them? Pausing them? Which repo or org runners do you have installed.
3. Activity - Easily look through active or past runs, figure out what worked and what failed
---

## The solution:

1. Easily see which runners are offline, online, or buzy
2. Easily add / remove or pause your runners
3. Easily look through sessions, individual jobs and action logs. 

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://eonist.github.io/runner-bar/install.sh | bash
```
